Makefile
- creates the new executable called winnable.

int isWinnable(int depth, Cards tabl[7][20], char foundation[4][2], Stock* stock, Waste* waste);
-return 1 if it satisfies the winning condition, 0 otherwise.

int validateMove(char src, char dest, Cards tabl[7][20], char foundation[4][2], Stock* stock, Waste* waste);
- return 1 if its a valid move, 0 otherwise by scanning tableau, foundation, stock, and waste cards.

Config executeMove(char src, char dest, Config config);
-executes the moves and returns the new game configuration.

Moves* getAllOriginMoves(Config config);
-return all possbile moves from a game configuration.

Config findWinnable(int depth, Config config, char src, char dest, int print);
- recursive function that executes the moves, calls getAllOriginMoves and iterate that list of new moves from the new game configuration which then calls findWinnable, the process repeats itself untill the base case is satisfied.

Features implemented by Wei Xian Lim :
